# ðŸ˜Ÿ Sentimental Analysis as Stress Detector

This project implements advanced **Sentiment Analysis** techniques to build an intelligent **stress detection system**. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models, it analyzes user-generated text to assess emotional states and detect possible stress levels â€” offering potential applications in mental health monitoring, productivity tools, and social platforms.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- ðŸ§  **Emotion & Stress Analysis** â€” Predicts sentiment and classifies potential stress levels based on input text.
- ðŸ”¤ **NLP-Powered** â€” Uses tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF or Word2Vec).
- ðŸ¤– **ML Models** â€” Trained various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) for stress prediction.
- ðŸ“Š **Evaluation Metrics** â€” Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix to evaluate model performance.
- ðŸ’¬ **User Interface (Optional)** â€” Can be integrated with Streamlit or Tkinter for a simple input-output interface.
