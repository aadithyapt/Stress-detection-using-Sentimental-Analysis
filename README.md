# 😟 Sentimental Analysis as Stress Detector

This project implements advanced **Sentiment Analysis** techniques to build an intelligent **stress detection system**. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models, it analyzes user-generated text to assess emotional states and detect possible stress levels — offering potential applications in mental health monitoring, productivity tools, and social platforms.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **Emotion & Stress Analysis** — Predicts sentiment and classifies potential stress levels based on input text.
- 🔤 **NLP-Powered** — Uses tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF or Word2Vec).
- 🤖 **ML Models** — Trained various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) for stress prediction.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics** — Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix to evaluate model performance.
- 💬 **User Interface (Optional)** — Can be integrated with Streamlit or Tkinter for a simple input-output interface.
